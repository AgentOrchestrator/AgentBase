-- Check extracted rules
SELECT
  id,
  rule_text,
  rule_category,
  confidence_score,
  source_session_ids
FROM extracted_rules
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check approval status
SELECT
  r.rule_text,
  ra.status,
  ra.created_at
FROM extracted_rules r
JOIN rule_approvals ra ON ra.rule_id = r.id
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Step 7: Error Scenarios

### Test Error Handling

**Scenario 1: No Conversations**
- If user has no chat histories
- Should show "No chat histories found"
- Should not crash

**Scenario 2: No Prompts**
- Temporarily disable all prompts in database
- Should show "No extraction prompts available"
- Should offer "Create a Prompt" button

**Scenario 3: Network Error**
- Throttle network to simulate slow connection
- Extraction should still show progress
- Should handle timeout gracefully

**Scenario 4: Memory Service Down**
- Stop memory service (if running)
- Extraction should fail gracefully
- Should show helpful error message

---

## Expected Results Summary

After complete testing, you should have:
- ‚úÖ Navigated through all 3 wizard steps
- ‚úÖ Selected conversations with search/filter
- ‚úÖ Chosen extraction prompt
- ‚úÖ Started extraction and seen progress
- ‚úÖ Completed extraction successfully
- ‚úÖ Viewed extracted rules in pending table
- ‚úÖ Tested back navigation (selections preserved)
- ‚úÖ Tested dark mode
- ‚úÖ Tested responsive design
- ‚úÖ Verified database entries created

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Memory Service Integration**: The actual AI extraction depends on the Python memory service. If not running, extractions will fail.
2. **Progress Simulation**: Progress is currently simulated. Real extraction may have different timing.
3. **Cancellation**: Cancel button shows but doesn't stop backend processing (future enhancement).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No conversations showing
**Solution:**
- Verify you have chat histories in database
- Check RLS policies allow viewing
- Look for errors in browser console

### Issue: Extraction fails immediately
**Solution:**
- Check if memory service is running
- Verify `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL` environment variable
- Check API logs for errors
- Ensure selected chat histories have valid data

### Issue: Progress stuck at certain percentage
**Solution:**
- This is normal during AI analysis
- Wait up to 2 minutes
- If still stuck, check backend logs

---

## Next Steps: Phase 2C

Once Phase 2B is working:
1. Implement file generation (`.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`)
2. Add file preview and download
3. Implement auto-sync functionality

**Happy Testing! üöÄ**

For issues, check browser console and server logs.
